# Final B Mac and the Benchwarmers

<h2>Tournament Bracket Randomizer</h2>
We made a form where you can find brackets to place teams and it will randomize who wins. This eventually ends with a winning team. The user puts the names of the neams in each textbox. The number of textboxes depends on the bracket the user choose. The user chooses the size of the bracket after the user presses start on the menu screen. Before starting the bracket all textboxes should be filled in by the user to have it be fully correct. There is a button for each round which puts names of teams that were chosen into labels for the next round. This will continue until there is a winner chosen and this occurs in every bracket that we made.
To start the bracket the user will press start in the menu which will then bring you to a bracket choosing form. This is where you choose the size of your bracket. After choosing it will take you to the bracket which then you can fill in all the textboxes. After that, let the tournament madness begin.<br><br>
To use this form, the user must install microsoft visual studio. The form is free to install. 
To run the bracket, there are buttons which will move the team's name to the next label. To continue the bracket, there wil me more buttons for the next round. The buttons are label so the user knows which button to press and when to press it.
To deploy this system, visual studio needs to be up with this form open. This will then start the user with our menu.
